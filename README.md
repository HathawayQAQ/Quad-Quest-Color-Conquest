# Quad-Quest-Color-Conquest

### Introduction
This project involves developing a visually engaging game where players manipulate a quad-tree structure through operations like rotations, reflections, or "smashing" to achieve a specific goal, reminiscent of the strategic complexities found in a Mondrian painting. Adapted from an original concept by the University of Toronto's Diane Horton and David Liu, the game generates a colorful board, tasking players with forming the largest connected area of a certain color or positioning a color along the perimeter. Players strategically alter sections of the board, with each move recalculating their score based on their success in meeting their objectives, leading to competitive gameplay that spans a predefined number of turns.
